# Majordom — Architecture & Technical Reference

> Stable technical facts. Read this before making any changes to core code.

## What Majordom is

A unified personal AI assistant — one app, one deployment, one LLM — with pluggable tool integrations per domain (finance, wellness, digital).

The user speaks to Majordom in natural language. Majordom calls the right tool, executes the action, and asks the user to confirm. The user never interacts directly with Actual Budget or other tools.

**Fundamental principles:**
- Zero financial data in the cloud — everything runs on your own server
- Majordom does not reinvent what specialist tools do — it calls them via REST API
- SQLite is only for conversational context, preferences, and domain memory — never financial data
- When in doubt, solve it in chat before building a new screen
- Majordom is an MCP server for external agents, not an MCP client — it calls services via REST

## Critical Technical Rules — DO NOT BREAK THESE

### 1. Async vs Sync — CRITICAL
The entire backend is **async** (FastAPI + asyncio). `ActualBudgetClient` runs sync `actualpy` code in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

```python
# CORRECT — sync in executor
async def get_accounts(self) -> list[Account]:
    def _get():
        with self._get_actual() as actual:
            actual.download_budget()
            return actual.get_accounts()
    return await self._run(_get)

# WRONG — blocks the entire event loop:
async def get_accounts(self):
    with self._get_actual() as actual:  # sync in async context!
        ...
```

### 2. actualpy — operation order is mandatory
```python
with self._get_actual() as actual:
    actual.download_budget()   # always first
    # ... operations ...
    actual.commit()            # always last, for any write
```

### 3. actualpy — naming quirks
- `imported_id` in `create_transaction()` is saved internally as `financial_id`. When reading: use `tx.financial_id`, not `tx.imported_id`.
- `create_transaction()` expects **EUR** (float), not cents. It converts internally via `decimal_to_cents()`.
- Queries pattern: `from actual.queries import get_transactions; get_transactions(actual.session, ...)` — there is no `actual.get_transactions()` method.

### 3b. actualpy — create_rule syntax (non-obvious, will fail silently with wrong values)
```python
from actual.rules import Rule, Condition, Action
from actual.queries import create_rule

rule = Rule(
    conditions=[Condition(field='imported_description', op='contains', value='PREFIX')],
    operation='and',
    actions=[Action(op='set', field='category', value=category_uuid)],
)
create_rule(actual.session, rule)  # takes session, NOT actual
actual.commit()
```
- `field='imported_description'` — matches the raw bank string. `field='description'` is the payee UUID (a different type — will reject string values).
- `Action(op='set', field='category', value=uuid)` — NOT `op='set-category'` (raises ValidationError).

### 4. Config — always from settings singleton
```python
# CORRECT:
from backend.core.config import settings
url = settings.ollama.url

# WRONG:
import os
url = os.environ["LLM_BASE_URL"]
```

### 5. No financial data in SQLite
SQLite (`memory.db`) is for conversational context and user preferences only. Transactions, balances, categories, budgets → Actual Budget. Any SQLite table storing financial data is a violation — remove it.

### 6. Confirmation card for all write tools
Every tool that modifies data MUST go through a proposal → confirmation card → execute flow. No direct execution.

```python
# Pattern:
_PROPOSAL_TOOLS = {"propose_transaction", "propose_budget_rebalance", ...}
# If tool name is in _PROPOSAL_TOOLS → yield JSON to frontend
# Frontend renders editable card → user confirms → POST /confirm endpoint
```

If a tool is missing from `_PROPOSAL_TOOLS` in `backend/api/chat.py`, the JSON goes to the LLM instead of the frontend — the card never appears.

### 7. Transaction deduplication
Majordom generates `SHA256(date + merchant + amount)[:16]` and passes it to Actual Budget as `imported_id`. Actual Budget owns deduplication — Majordom does not query duplicates itself.

`imported_id` must be passed on **every** creation path, including both legs of a transfer (`ab_create_transfer`) — a path that skips it becomes invisible to dedup and duplicates on any future overlapping import. See issue #102.

Every transaction creation path must also set `cleared` explicitly (see `client.py:1075` for the reference pattern) — a path that omits it leaves transactions permanently unreconciled regardless of what the user does afterward. See issue #101.

### 8. Transfers
A transfer between two on-budget accounts = two linked transactions in Actual Budget, never two separate expense/income transactions. Use `actualpy.create_transfer()` or `set_transaction_payee()` with a payee that has `transfer_acct` set.

### 9. LLM context window
With 20+ tool schemas (~3500 tokens) + system prompt (~600), `num_ctx` must be at least 8192. On Ollama native `/api/chat`: set in `options.num_ctx`. On OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`: `options` is ignored — use a provider that supports large context (OpenRouter).

### 10. OpenAI format vs Ollama format
`tool_calls[].function.arguments` is a **string** in OpenAI format, a **dict** in Ollama native. Always:
```python
if isinstance(args, str):
    args = json.loads(args)
```

### 11. `think: false` for qwen3 models
qwen3 and qwen3.5 have thinking mode enabled by default. Always send `"think": false` in the Ollama payload, otherwise the response is blocked for tens of seconds with no visible output.

### 12. AB goal template syntax (fails silently with wrong syntax)
`"up to X"` and `"by DATE"` are mutually exclusive template types — `#template up to 2000 by 2026-07` is invalid and fails **silently** (0.00 everywhere on the category, no visible error in the UI). Correct: `#template 2000 by 2026-07` (no "up to"). Date format: `YYYY-MM`. If the target month is the current month and balance is 0, the whole amount is calculated at once.

AB also has a newer **"Budget Automations"** system (structured UI, not free text) that removes this risk entirely — if `actualpy`/the AB API exposes it, prefer it over writing raw `#template` text into category notes. See issue #124.

Separately: if a category's target month has already passed (goal reached), "Overwrite with budget template" errors on that category and halts the whole batch. Any tool driving this must process categories independently, not as one call that can fail globally.

### 13. AB "Total Income (YTD)" and Net Worth reports include Starting Balances
Account opening balances are counted as "income" at import time in AB's native reports (Total Income YTD, Net Worth graph — visible as a vertical jump when large accounts are added). Any income/net-worth calculation Majordom does must explicitly exclude "Starting Balances" transactions, or projections/alerts will be based on inflated numbers. See issue #112.

### 14. Home "Needs resolving" widget must bypass digest anti-spam
`get_pending_items()` (backend/services/notification_service.py) powers the Home widget's live pending-items list and must always reflect *current* unresolved state. The digest's `_check_*()` functions bake in "don't repeat the same alert within N days" anti-spam — reusing one of those as-is silently hides a still-true condition from the widget just because the digest already pushed it once this week (found via `_check_vehicle_reminders`, see 2026-07-03 session). Any digest check wired into `get_pending_items()` needs its anti-spam bypassed explicitly (e.g. `_check_vehicle_reminders(db, ignore_anti_spam=True)`), or reimplemented independently like the uncategorized/unreconciled/budget/goal checks already are.

Also: don't build automatic staleness/noise heuristics from account metadata alone (e.g. "no transaction in N days") without a way to distinguish accounts that are supposed to sit idle (savings/goal buckets) from ones that aren't — an opt-in watchlist (`_CSV_STALENESS_WATCHLIST`) was tried as a middle ground and still produced friction (its own "resync X" prompt hit rule 16's `balanceType` bug). **Final call (2026-07-03): both the bank-sync and CSV staleness checks were removed from `get_pending_items()` entirely** — manual resync/import stays available on request via chat, just not auto-surfaced on Home.

Same principle applies to any pending-item type that duplicates information already shown elsewhere on Home in its own dedicated widget (e.g. the goal-risk item duplicated the "Financial Goals" section's own progress bars) — if the full detail is already visible on the page, don't also nudge about it in "Needs resolving".

### 15. actualpy's bank-sync `BalanceType` enum doesn't cover every bank's codes
GoCardless-linked banks can return a `balanceType` code actualpy's `BalanceType` enum (`actual/api/bank_sync.py`) doesn't recognize (observed: ING NL sends `"XPCD"`), which crashes `run_bank_sync()` with a pydantic validation error before any transaction is parsed — even on the latest actualpy version (checked 0.22.3, same fixed enum list). We never read this field, only the imported transactions, so `backend/core/actual_client/client.py` monkey-patches `BalanceType._missing_` at import time to fall back to `INFORMATION` for any unrecognized code instead of raising.

### 16. PWA service worker: never cache-first the app shell
`frontend/public/sw.js` must serve navigations and `/index.html` **network-first** (cache only as an offline fallback). Vite gives every JS/CSS bundle a fresh content hash per build, but the shell's own URL never changes — cache-first on the shell let the browser keep serving an old `index.html` (pointing at old bundle hashes) indefinitely after a deploy, regardless of how many times the backend redeployed. Hashed static assets are still safe to cache-first (a content change gives them a new URL). `CACHE_NAME` needed a one-time bump to flush what was already stuck; going forward the network-first shell strategy is what prevents recurrence, not the cache name.

### 17. Card confirm/cancel results must be explicitly persisted to chat history
A card resolving into a `status` message (bank resync, category actions, transfers, ...) does **not** automatically get saved server-side — only a plain-text assistant reply after the user's message does (`handleSendText`'s `onComplete` in `frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx`). Without separate handling, the whole exchange (including the user's own message) vanishes the next time chat history reloads from the server (e.g. `visibilitychange` while navigating). Fixed with an effect that watches for new `status`-role messages and persists each one (with its preceding user message) exactly once, using a `WeakSet` to avoid reprocessing and a `_synced` flag (set on messages loaded from the server) to avoid re-saving already-persisted ones. Any new card type should just work automatically through this effect — no per-card-type wiring needed.

### 18. Dumping a Docker volume via a throwaway container leaves root-owned files
`scripts/backup.sh` copies the Actual Budget Docker volume into a host tmpdir via `docker run ... alpine cp -a ...` — the container runs as root by default, so everything it writes into the bind-mounted tmpdir is root-owned on the host, even though the tmpdir itself was created by the (non-root) host user. A plain `rm -rf "$TMPDIR"` afterward fails with "Permission denied" on those files — silently leaking a root-owned directory in `/tmp` on every run. Fix: clean up through a root container too (`docker run --rm -v "$TMPDIR":/backup alpine rm -rf /backup`), not the host shell — the same pattern applies to any future script that dumps a Docker volume to the host filesystem this way. Note the container will still print (and can't avoid) `rm: can't remove '/backup': Resource busy` for the mount point itself — that's expected and harmless, contents underneath are still removed; redirect stderr if the noise matters.

### 19. `majordom-api` needs `--build`, not just `restart`, for Python changes to take effect
Unlike a typical dev setup, `majordom-api` in `docker-compose.yml` only bind-mounts `./data` and `./backups` — the backend source is `COPY`'d into the image at build time (`Dockerfile.backend`). `docker compose restart majordom-api` restarts the *existing* image unchanged; it silently keeps serving old code with no error, no warning, and the container looks healthy. Verify by grepping the running container's source (`docker exec majordom-api grep ... /app/backend/...`) if a code change doesn't seem to take effect. Always use `docker compose up -d --build majordom-api` after editing backend Python. (`majordom-web` has the same constraint — it's a built Nginx+static image too, no source bind-mount.)

## Main Flows

### Receipt photo (web)
```
User uploads photo
  → POST /api/receipts (multipart)
  → VisionEngine.extract_from_bytes() — LLM vision model
  → SmartCategorizer.suggest() — check merchant_mappings (SQLite)
  → if multiple accounts: ask user
  → on confirm: ActualBudgetClient.add_transaction()
```

### Fuel receipt (photo)
```
User uploads photo
  → VisionEngine detects receipt_type="fuel"
  → returns ReceiptDraft with liters, price_per_liter, vehicles, suggested_vehicle_id
  → FuelReceiptCard (tabbed: Fuel / Grocery)
  → confirm → POST /api/receipts/{id}/confirm-fuel
  → reads last_odo BEFORE insert → AB transaction + vehicle_log INSERT
```

**Key rule:** last ODO must be read BEFORE inserting the new entry — otherwise `km_since_last = 0`.

### Fuel refuel (text — log_refuel tool)
```
User: "I refueled 40L at Shell for €90, odo 51500"
  → LLM calls log_refuel(liters, total_eur, location, odo_km)
  → pending proposal in vehicle_proposals (in-memory dict)
  → "log_refuel" in _PROPOSAL_TOOLS → yield JSON to frontend
  → FuelReceiptCard (no image, no Grocery tab)
  → confirm → POST /api/vehicle/proposals/{id}/confirm
  → reads last_odo BEFORE insert → AB transaction + vehicle_log INSERT
```

### Chat with tool calling
```
User sends message
  → POST /api/chat
  → _fetch_financial_context() — accounts + stats + recent tx from AB (single session)
  → system prompt built with financial snapshot
  → LLM generates response with optional tool calls
  → if tool in _PROPOSAL_TOOLS → yield JSON card to frontend
  → else → append tool result, LLM generates text response
  → streamed back to frontend
```

### CSV import
```
User uploads CSV via + button in chat
  → POST /api/import/csv/preview
  → bank2ynab converts to standard format
  → CsvImportCard in chat
  → confirm → POST /api/import/csv/confirm
  → transfer detection (Code=GT for ING), unknown income → IncomeSourceCard
  → ActualBudgetClient.add_transactions_batch() with SHA256 deduplication
```

### Daily digest (APScheduler)
```
run_daily_digest() at configured time (default 20:00):
  _check_financial_summary()  → text or None
  _check_import_nudge()       → text or None
  _check_pending_review()     → text or None
  _check_vehicle_reminders()  → list[str] or []
  → concatenate with " · "
  → PushService.broadcast() — single Web Push to all subscribers
  → save to chat_history for all active users
```

---

## Authentication

- 2 users defined in `.env` (username + bcrypt password)
- JWT tokens, 7-day expiry
- No OAuth, no role-based access, no server-side sessions

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ACTUAL_BUDGET_URL` | Internal Docker URL (`http://actual-budget:5006`) |
| `ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASSWORD` | Actual Budget password |
| `ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` | Sync ID from AB Settings → Advanced |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | LLM provider URL — no trailing `/v1` (code adds it) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | API key (empty for local Ollama) |
| `LLM_CHAT_MODEL` | Chat model ID |
| `LLM_VISION_MODEL` | Vision model ID |
| `LLM_CATEGORIZE_MODEL` | Model for CSV categorization (optional, defaults to chat) |
| `MEMORY_DB_PATH` | SQLite path (`/app/data/memory.db`) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for JWT tokens (32-byte hex) |
| `USER1_USERNAME` / `USER1_PASSWORD` | Web UI credentials |

**Important:** `LLM_BASE_URL` must NOT end with `/v1` — the code appends `/v1/chat/completions` automatically. If set to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, you get double `/v1`.

---

## Docker Services

```yaml
actual-budget  ← port 127.0.0.1:5006:5006, data in ./data/actual
ollama         ← port 11434, models in ollama_data volume (optional, local inference)
majordom       ← FastAPI backend (port 8000) + React frontend via Nginx (port 3000)
```

All services share `majordom-net` bridge network. Backend addresses AB as `http://actual-budget:5006`.

---

## Pre-commit hook — private data patterns

`scripts/check-private-data.sh` scans staged diffs for sensitive patterns. One gotcha affects normal code:

The hook blocks `PASSWORD=<value>` unless the value starts with a whitelisted prefix (`settings.`, `cfg.`, `your_`, `example`, etc.).

**Rule:** when instantiating `ActualBudgetClient`, always pass credentials directly from `settings.<section>.<field>` or `cfg.<field>` — never as a hardcoded string, never as a variable whose name doesn't start with a whitelisted prefix.

---

## MCP Server (planned)

Majordom will expose its tool registry through MCP standard. Any MCP-compatible agent (OpenClaw, Hermes, Claude) can call Majordom's tools directly. Implementation scheduled after M2 — tracked in issue #58.

---

---

## Target Architecture (incremental migration — June 2026+)

> This is the direction, not the current state. Each service is extracted when work happens on it anyway. No big-bang rewrites.

### Life-OS structure (target)

### Majordom roles (target)
- Conversational UI with cards and charts
- Proactive daily digest
- MCP server — external agents (OpenClaw, Claude API, Hermes) call Majordom's tools
- REST client — Majordom calls each service via its REST API (no MCP client internally)

### Abstractization vs extraction — two different mechanisms

The codebase has two layers that couple to Actual Budget, resolved differently:

**Tool layer** — what the LLM calls conversationally (`tools/finance/actual_budget.py`, `api/category_actions.py`, `services/notification_service.py`):
→ **M5.2 FinanceProvider Protocol** — stays in Majordom, calls an abstract interface. Switch provider = one env var.

**API layer** — PWA-specific endpoints (`api/transactions.py`, `api/accounts.py`, `api/csv_import.py`, `api/receipts.py`, etc.):
→ **M6 physical extraction** — these files disappear from Majordom. Logic moves to independent services (`csv-importer/`, `receipt-scanner/`, `finance/`). Majordom makes HTTP calls instead.

Do NOT try to wrap the API layer with FinanceProvider — it will be extracted entirely in M6, not abstracted in place.

### FinanceProvider abstraction (M5.2 — tool layer only)

Majordom's tool registry calls a `FinanceProvider` protocol, not AB/Sure directly:

```python
class FinanceProvider(Protocol):
    async def get_accounts(self) -> list[Account]: ...
    async def get_transactions(self, ...) -> list[Transaction]: ...
    async def create_transaction(self, ...) -> str: ...
    async def get_budget_status(self) -> BudgetStatus: ...
    # ~15 methods total — exactly what tools/finance/actual_budget.py calls

class ActualBudgetProvider:   # current — wraps actualpy
    ...

class SureProvider:           # future — Sure REST API
    ...
```

Config: `FINANCE_BACKEND=actual_budget` (default) or `sure`. Switching backends requires no code changes in the tool layer.

### Tool domain routing

Tools are prefixed by domain. A single LLM sees all tools and routes based on prefix + structured system prompt.

**Domains:**

| Prefix | Domain | Services |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `finance__` | Budget, transactions, investments, bank sync | Actual Budget, Sure |
| `vehicle__` | Vehicle log, fuel, reminders | SQLite vehicle_log |
| `system__` | Cross-cutting app settings/ops (notification time, backup status) | Majordom backend |
| `home__` | Lights, climate, automations | Home Assistant |
| `media__` | Photos, documents, files | Immich, Nextcloud |

**Tool naming:** `{domain}__{action}` — e.g. `finance__propose_transaction`, `vehicle__log_refuel`

**System prompt structure:**
```
## Finance tools
Use finance__ tools when the user mentions money, budget, transactions, accounts, investments.
  - finance__propose_transaction: spending or receiving money
  - finance__propose_set_category_budget: set a budget amount for a category
  ...

## Vehicle tools
Use vehicle__ tools when the user mentions car, fuel, APK, insurance, mileage.
  ...
```

**Migration to Option B (hierarchical routing):**
When local inference becomes primary and tool count grows, add a router LLM layer on top of `chat_service.py`. Tool definitions stay unchanged — the router just picks the domain and delegates. Triggered by hardware upgrade (AMD iGPU mini PC) or >30 tools per domain.

### Incremental migration strategy

- **Never stop current development** for structural migration
- **Extract a service** when working on that feature anyway (e.g., extract `vehicle-manager/` during next vehicle feature sprint)
- **Each extracted service** gets its own repo, Docker image, REST API, and README
- **Audit after each migration step** — verify existing functionality before moving on
- `majordom-financiar/` → `majordom/` rename happens when folder restructure is triggered by other work
